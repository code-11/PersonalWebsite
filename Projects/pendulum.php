				Modeling of a Pendulum-Spring System			</p>	
			<hr/>
		</div>
		<p class="snippettext">This was a modeling of a multiple pendulum system where the bobs are connected by springs. This simulation was made in Matlab and due to vectorized inputs, supports many different kinds of changes to the system like initial position and velocity in three deminsions.</p><br />A partner and I created this physics simulation using the Matlab's  ode45 differential equation solver. We analyized the forces on the bob and came up with a system of differential equations that described that motion. Because the equations have no analytical solution, we used matlab to to solve them for us.
<br /><br />
Finally, having acheived our basic goals for the project, we vectorized all the inputs and state varaibles of the system to allow 3 dimensional movement and initial parameters.	</div>
