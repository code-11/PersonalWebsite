		<p class="snippettext">This website is a place where I can put my accomplishments and projects. It is written from scratch using html, css and php </p><br />I realized while in my last year of highschool I had done a significant amount of projects. 
Not only that, but that my resume did a poor job of describing and providing detail on these projects. 
I knew some web development from high school, so I put together this website while I figured out how things worked.
<br/><br/>
While I put together this site, I learned a valuable lesson: always record and save your projects, regardless of what they are.
While I may remember the turn-based strategy game I made in 7th grade on my graphing calculator, the code (and the device) are gone forever.
This site allows me to record my progress on different projects in a way that can develop and grow throughout my life.
<br/><br/>
Concerning the site itself, it is structured using a mix of static and dynamic pages.
I used to use a snippet based templating system I made myself in php, but realized that most of it was unnessesary. Now it is almost all static html with some php includes for reuse.
<br/><br/>
Obviously the html of the page itself can be found by hitting Ctrl-U (on firefox and chrome, not sure about IE).</div>
