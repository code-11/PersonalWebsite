		<p class="snippettext">A team and I made a image manipulation API in python that is capable of preforming edge detection, gaussian blur, rotation and other common image operations.</p><br />

This project was part of Linearity 2, a class taught at Olin College. Thus, the under workings of the API work off of linear algebra concepts like rotation using a matrix rather than an algorithm.
<br /><br />
A more in-depth explanation of the project can be found 
<a href='../Documents/Singularity_Vortex_Presentation.pdf'>here</a>.<br /><br />
Furthermore, the code for the project itself and many sample images showcasing the ability of the API can be found
<a href='../Documents/Singularity-Vortex-master.zip'>here</a>.<br /><br />
The project was completed in python using the scipy and numpy modules. A README is included with the project.
