		<p class="snippettext">The Audializer was a Signals and Sytems project where a team and I created software that would convert an image into sound.</p><br />
In Spring 2013, I worked with a team of two others to create a matlab program that could take an image and convert it to sound.

Unsurprisingly, we found that most images, when directly converted, do not sound all that melodic.

A more comprehensive final report can be found 
<a href="../Documents/SigSysFinalReport.pdf">here</a>.<br/><br/>
In addition, in order to further illustrate how the program worked, we created the video below:

(Warning: Some sound clips are loud)
<br/><br/>
We were able to create a image to sound coverter. However, our two stretch goals, for the process to be lossless and for it to sound pleasing, proved to be beyond our time frame for the project.
