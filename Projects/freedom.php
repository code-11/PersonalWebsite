		<p class="snippettext">A freedom toaster is a peice of hardware that is capable of burning copies of open source hardware. At Washington Lee Highschool the IT club and I constructed our own toaster from an old Kodak photo kiosk</p><br />
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Toaster'>The freedom toaster page on wikipedia</a>.
<br /><br />
The project took two years but is now fully functional and operating at the Washington Lee High School Library.
<br /><br />
My part in the construction of the kiosk was mainly higher level planning, some programming, physical refurbishment and convincing other team members to attend meetings.
<br /><br />
Our freedom toaster project has its own website which can be found
