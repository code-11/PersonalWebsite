				I am currently a student at Cornell Tech in New York City.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				I am working towards a masters in computer science.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				I enjoy computer programming, making and playing video games, skiing, staying up-to-date with world politics, writing, science fiction and economics.

			<p>
				I have been lucky enough to work on some really cool projects, both at school and in industry. An overview of these projects can be found in the projects link above.
