			<img class="snippetimage" src="Pictures/audializer.png" />
			<div class= "snippettextbox">
				<p class="snippettext">The Audializer was a Signals and Sytems project where a team and I created software that would convert an image into sound. The project was coded in both matlab and python.</p>

			<img class="snippetimage" src="Pictures/springs.png" />
			<div class= "snippettextbox">
				<p class="snippettext">This was a modeling of a multiple pendulum system where the bobs are connected by springs. This simulation was made in Matlab and due to vectorized inputs, supports many different kinds of changes to the system like initial position and velocity in three deminsions.</p>

			<img class="snippetimage" src="Pictures/nnapi.png" />
			<div class= "snippettextbox">
				<p class="snippettext">I created a Neural Network API in python from scratch. A neural network is series of inter-connected nodes, that upon evaluation, preform a certain task. They are mostly used for object recognition and classification. <br/><br/> This API supports feed-foward, single output neural networks and trains the networks using my implementation of the back propagation algorithm.</p>
